Simple explanation of selectors:

a > b (Direct child)

Example: main > section
Means: "Select b only if it's directly inside a"
Like selecting sections that are right inside main, not deeper nested


a ~ b (General sibling)

Example: p ~ p
Means: "Select b if it comes after a and they share the same parent"
Like selecting all paragraphs that come after another paragraph


a + b (Adjacent sibling)

Example: h1 + *
Means: "Select b if it comes immediately after a"
Like selecting any element that comes right after an h1


a b (Descendant)

Example: footer p
Means: "Select b if it's anywhere inside a"
Like selecting all paragraphs inside a footer, no matter how deeply nested
